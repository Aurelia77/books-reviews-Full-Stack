# Book-Reviews 🗣️

## Introduction 📚

This is a web application that lets you search for books using the Google Books API and organize them into personal lists (read, to read, currently reading). Users can view, sort (by title, date, rating, favorites), and manage their book collections.
You can also add friends, see books read by all members, your friends, or a specific friend.

## Contributing 🤝

If you'd like to contribute, please follow these steps:

1. **Create a New Branch**:  
   Always create a new branch from `develop` to test new features. Use a naming convention that clearly describes the feature or fix you're working on. For example, if you're adding a new calendar for registration feature, you might name your branch `feature/registration-calendar`.

2. **Keep `develop` Up to Date**:  
   Before starting work on a new feature or fix, make sure your local `develop` branch is up to date with the remote repository. You can do this by running:  
   `git checkout develop`  
   `git pull`  
   `npm install`

   2.b **Keep `develop` Up to Date with a branch already created**:  
   `git checkout nameOfYourBranch`  
   `git pull origin develop`  
   `npm install`

3. **Submit a Pull Request**:  
   Once you've made your changes and tested them, submit a pull request to the `develop` branch.
